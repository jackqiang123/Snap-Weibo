# Snap-Weibo
A Java Web project.
Develop a blog webapp system using Java EE. The system allows people to share blogs with each other; however, the shared messages are valid only for a limited time period, which works in a "snap-blog" way. After that period, the publisher can still access to the message, while others can no longer reader them.
